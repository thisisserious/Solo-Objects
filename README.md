# Solo - Objects

- Reason why I'm doing this: This is an exercise to test my abilities at creating objects. I chose to use a constructor function because it's a little trickier for me and I need more practice with it.
- Reason why I chose to model this team as an object: I am not familiar with the sports-ball teams and I am a total movie nerd so I chose my favorite team of actors who frequently appear in mockumentaries together.

# Output
### Example

```Christopher Guest is an English-American actor most well-known for his breakout role as Nigel Tufnel in 'This Is Spinal Tap' (1984). 'Waiting for Guffman' (1997) was Guest's next big movie in which he introduced actors (Catherine O'Hara, Fred Willard, Parker Posey, and Bob Balaban to name a few) who would go on to make several more mockumentaries with him over the next 15 years. The next film to be released by almost the entire Guest team will be 'Mascots' (Netflix original, 2016) in which Guest reprises a 'Guffman' character. So dust off your dance belt and tube of chapstick 'cause Corky St. Clair is back!```
